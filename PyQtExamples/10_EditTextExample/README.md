# Line edit example
In this example, we show how to enter text by the user, using a QLineEdit object.
In this case, we add a box where the user can enter its text, and a push button to
confirm that it finished entered its text. Then, the entered string is shown
in a label below the QLineEdit object.

This example can be used, for instance, when we need to enter a pattern to
search a file, to enter the file name we want to use when we write a file
in disk, or when we want to grab some information from the user to create
a user database, for instance.

This object can be used also to only show some text, that we loaded from a file,
for instance, and the user cannot modify it. This can be done if we set the QLineEdit
object as read-only.
