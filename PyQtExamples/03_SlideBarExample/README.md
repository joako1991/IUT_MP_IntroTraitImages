# Slider example
This example adds an slider bar, that can be changed using either the mouse
or the arrows of the keyboard. This slider can be useful when we want to
change a variable continuously, and see its effect. Each time the slider value
changes, a function is called, that in this example, it prints a message
with the actual value of the slider.
