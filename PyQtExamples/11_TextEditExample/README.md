# Text edit example
The Text edit object from Qt allows to create text in several lines. It allows
also to change text parameters, like type of letter, size, and alignment, between
others. Then, entered text, can be retrieved, and for instance, be stored in
a text file.

Another possible application is, if we are willing users to write comments
about the application, we can use this object to allow them to enter a bigger
text, than a simple Line Edit. We can also write chat applications with it,
where we show the text entered by each participant of the chat on the text edit
object.

This object can be also set as read-only, to avoid the users to enter text directly
on it, but we can add lines into it using lines of code instead.

In this example, we show how to create the QTextEdit object, how to add text
by code, change the mode to read-only, and add it to the layout.
