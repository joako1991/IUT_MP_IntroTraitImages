# Labels example
This is one of the most basic examples of things we can do with Qt. This example
creates two labels.

A label is just an object that shows text. But since it inherits from a QWidget,
we can do with them many of the actions that can be done with any widget, like
touching it and getting the corrdinates of the point we touch. Since it involves
text, we can change its font, the size, the type (italic, bold). And of course,
we can update its text as many times we want.

In this example, we set some text to the labels only. Of course, this text can be changed
later on in the code.
