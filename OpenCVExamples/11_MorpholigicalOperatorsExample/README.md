# Morphological operators example
In this example, the morphological operators are implemented, and used over
an image with several spots of liquid metal. Aftering binarizing the image,
we apply the different morphological operators to it: Dilation, erosion,
opening and closing.

In this example, other images are attached, in order to undertand the function
of each operator. These images are taken from the OpenCV library explanation:
