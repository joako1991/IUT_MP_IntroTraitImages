# Connected components example
This example shows an application of connected components and labeling. We have
an image composed by liquid metal, and we want to identify the amount of particles
present in the image. After binarizing the image, we labeled using the connected
components algorithms, which will create the different classes of the binary
regions found.

After this step, we can do particle analysis, in order to filter the particles,
and choose only the ones that complies with certain criteria.
