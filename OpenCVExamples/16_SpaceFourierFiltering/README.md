# Load and show image example
This is the minimal example we can do with OpenCV. We load an image
from disk (either color or gray-level) and we show it.
Once the image is loaded, we can treat it as a matrix of numbers,
and we can do operations on it. In this case, we only
show them with the imshow method, and we exit the program when the user clicks
on the letter q or Q in the keyboard.

Check how the same image can be shown, depending on the passed flag in the
imread function, and the titles given on each imshow window.
